My child had the skill of saying when she needed to go to the bathroom, and initiating  each day to take a bath. After about two weeks on this medication she lost those skills, no longer mentioned she wanted to take a bath on her own and when I tried taking her a bath she was resistant to it and when I would take her to the bathroom to use the restroom she was resistance. She also became constipated. Thank goodness I took her off this.\"',\n"," '\"Treated for a UTI, was given a 7 day dose to take twice a day.

I sit with my son to help him with his homework. Now I find time to do stuff instead of &quot;relaxing&quot; or &quot;recharging&quot; my batteries in my bed.  This pill is amazing.  It has changed my lifestyle so far.  I do have some difficulty sleeping and dry mouth, but it&#039;s great.\"',\n"," '\"I was prescribed Imbruvica for CLL after being in remission for several years. The past protocols had always worked but where very hard on my system. The side effects weren&#039;t as extreme as with other treatments. But Imbruvica did not work at all for me. Taking the drug has made my health &amp; quality of life worse and now having stage 4 CLL my prognosis is grim. I lay in the hospital having numerous transfusions that are nothing more then a bandaid for my very soon eminent death.\"',\n"," '\"By far the best birth control pill I&#039;ve taken.\\r\\r\\nPeriods are super light and cramping is minimal to none. No weight gain or bloating.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nBest part for me is my insurance covers it for free! This has never happened for me.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nBiggest downsides I&#039;ve experienced are spotting if you are off by a few hours from your normal time and my mood swings are been considerable.  I&#039;ve found myself to be a little more irrational and emotional. I&#039;ve had a lot of stress, so I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s a direct effect of the pill, since no one else seems to be having mood swings.\"',\n"," '\"I&#039;ve been on this pill for about a month and I love it. No mood swings and same sex drive. The only noticable difference is my breasts! They are so tender. They feel as if I have a 90 pound clip hanging on my nipples. I do get nauseous through out the day but its bearable. My weight is the same. Sometimes I have an appetite, other times I don&#039;t. Overall, this is a great birth control.\"',\n"," '\"Started on 10mg of Viibryd and have been taking it for over 6 weeks.\\r\\nFirst week I experienced being &quot;spacey&quot;, diarrhea and no appetite.  After the first week, I started to feel better and have improved quite a bit.  Anxiety is gone but still have &quot;anger&quot; issues, although not as bad prior to Viibryd. \\r\\nAsking the doctor to up the dosage to 20mg to possible help with anger issues.\\r\\nOtherwise, Viibryd is about the best anti-depressant I&#039;ve ever taken.  Much better than Wellbutrin/Zoloft/Prozac/Celexa/etc.\"',\n"," '\"I have used valerian off and on for 26 years, no major side effect, at low doses. Usually I used this herb for insomnia which it works well. Also can be used for anxiety and stress; again at a low dosage. I would recommend on line information for your questions plus herbal specialists in your community. Do not  exclude your doctor a MD or equally qualified professional. I am now adding valerian at night in conjunction with \\r\\nZyprexa and Klonapin.   Zyprexa at 15 mg on e pill, Klonapin at 0.50 or 1 mg dose.  Do not recommend this combination yet to anybody. I am in the experimental phase.  Stormy1959\"',\n"," '\"Very good for me.\"',\n"," '\"Taking Wellbutrin 300XL for a while now. Previously used a SSRI which had little to no effect in that I would contemplate suicide nearly daily and had zero interest in life in general.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nNow I actually want to do things again, I am enjoying life and I have more energy. I can&#039;t say enough how well this drug has worked for me. Only side effect I&#039;ve experienced is decreased appetite and I&#039;ve lost a few pounds, which for me is a good thing.\"',\n","

Then both of my parents got sick and out of nowhere I could barely eat, go out and everyday felt like a battle. I was prescribed Lexapro and at first I was so anxious to take the medicine that the first week of taking it really spiked my anxiety. After about 10-14 days I felt amazing! I could eat again without feeling like I was choking on everything and I felt like my old self again. Actually like a better version of my old self. I would strongly recommend this medicine to anyone suffering from anxiety. Just know that it takes a little while for it to work and the first week can be terrible. Just stick with it!\"',\n"," '\"All my life I&#039;ve suffered from depression. Within the last year, severe anxiety came out of nowhere and I&#039;d have about 2 or three bad attacks per month, on top of the multiple small attacks I&#039;d get daily. ESPECIALLY in social settings. But even alone. I completely withdrew myself from my classes and my social life because of this. \\r\\n\\r\\n I started going to church. Meditating, running, praying, dieting, yoga, and trying to practice mindfulness.The failed attempts worsened my depression.\\r\\n\\r\\n I wanted the anxiety to stop so bad that I frequently considered suicide.  Its been less than a day taking Lexapro but I&#039;m so hopeful. Everything that felt like such a huge deal just hours ago are so minimal now. \"',\n"," '\"this medicine saves my life when I&#039;m having a panic attack. wish I could take this every day but it&#039;s addictive and I&#039;m told to only take as needed. I also have IBS and this makes everything go away. when I take this I never have IBS I can eat whatever I want no worries and sleep amazing!!

If it wasn&#039;t for the issues with dependency and withdrawal it would be a ten out of ten for me.\\r\\nI will note that after I stopped using it semi-regularly, I became better at dealing with anxiety &quot;on my own&quot; so to speak, and experienced less anxiety overall as I improved my coping skills. Still, I&#039;m really grateful for this medication and encourage other miserably anxious people out there to discuss it with their doctors. It really improved my life when I thought nothing could.\"',\n"," '\"Buspar was the first medicine prescribed to me for anxiety. I started out taking 5mg three times per day, then the dosage was increased to 10mg twice per day, but I had to go back to the 5mg dosage because I got extremely lightheaded at higher dosages.

Two years after she was born, I couldnt take it anymore and I had to get help.  I talked to my doctor and was put on Lexapro, 10 mg.  I hated it at first.  I was dizzy and &quot;swimmy&quot; feeling, couldnt sleep, couldnt eat, felt out of it, couldn&#039;t care less about things that were going on.  This only lasted about a week!  Then, I could gradually feel myself getting used to it.  My next appt, my dosage was upped to 20 mg (he started me on 10 because he wanted to ease me into it knowing I was a mom and worked full time; i still needed to function).

I have never been able to sleep on a plane (even during international flights), but it calmed me down to the point I fell asleep during both flights.

They are so scary because no matter how many times I have suffered through them, I am always sure I am dying when I have one.

I don&#039;t expect to take it for the rest of my life, but I go thro prolonged periods of anxiety and antisocial behavior (will urinate in bottles in my room when at my worst).

This was many years ago and I remember that it had a very quick effect on me. Anxiety gone in one day and depression was almost totally eliminated in 4 weeks. I realize now that this is an older\\r\\nantidepressant/antianxiety medication but I believe it is much under prescribed as it helps not only with the emotional problems but helps with pain and sleep.

Every doctor told me in the UK we get talking therapy and an SSRI for anxiety, but never benzo&#039;s. So I suffered on for years and years until 4 months ago I found a Dr who prescribed me Xanax (Alprazolam) 0.5mg 3 times a day (1mg if needed) and it is a miracle drug to me.

After the birth of my son, I developed insomnia and anxiety. I placed a lot of pressure on myself to get enough sleep and the result was not being able to sleep. In addition, I have very high expectations of myself. I work from home and was studying at the time. From this, I caused so much anxiety for myself to the point where I couldn&#039;t control my thoughts and feelings. I was prescribed Zoloft which probably made me more anxious and I was on that for a year. My GP switched me to Lexapro 4 months ago.  On this med I feel like a different person.

After two days I already feel way more control of my thoughts. I&#039;ll still get anxious but it&#039;s way more manageable now. I&#039;ve also noticed on this site that the negative reviews seem to be people who have already had xanax or something prior to this drug.

Because of my addiction history, I am very careful with it and never take it more than prescribed. It is enough to make me feel &quot;evened out&quot; during the day without making me loopy, euphoric or sleepy.

I was having social phobia as well. I&#039;m 40 yrs old and I think my hormones was making my anxiety worse during my period. I finally got the nerve of going to a doctor for medicines. I thought I could beat this on my own but at this point I just couldn&#039;t. The Doctor prescribed Paxil and Clonazepam. I decided to try Clonazepam at 0.025 and I already feel like myself again.

Took me a while to realize the elephant in the room- it was the &quot;anti-anxiety&quot; drugs!

It seems especially good for anxiety attacks.  While they did not entirely go away, seemed to lessen them to the extent that they were a minor occasional nuisance rather than something that prevented me from living a normal life and leaving the house.

Taking it when you don&#039;t need to will only create addiction and the withdrawal is worse than living with the actual anxiety. Please don&#039;t take this med unless you suffer from anxiety and you are having a panic attack. It works well in these situations but my advice is to stay away from it and only take it in an emergency. I prefer lorazepam. When you take lorazepam the withdrawal symptoms are more tolerable than xanax. Xanax is awesome but it can become Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.
