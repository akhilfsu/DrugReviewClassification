I&#039;m not sure what the next step is!\"',\n"," '\"I started on Aviane when I was 15. It&#039;s got the job done with making sure I don&#039;t get pregnant. But all other aspects of it are completely horrible. It makes me way more irritable, I gained 30 pounds( and I&#039;m a healthy person, I always watch what I eat  and I exercise ), my acne is worse, I&#039;m moody, emotional, and more sad. It literally makes me crazy. I&#039;m a totally different person on it. I am now 24 and I am stopping it this month. I would never go on it again. But now I am at a loss of what to do because I don&#039;t want to get pregnant. I&#039;m thinking of getting the nonhormonal copper IUD but I&#039;m not sure. Any advice would be welcome to. But do not take this drug.\"',\n"," '\"I have been taking Phentermine since 09/18/08 at 191 pounds.  Honestly, I haven&#039;t weighed in yet, but I feel terrific.  My energy level is way high. I&#039;m a 40 year old college professor, and have been used to taking naps before working at night (I would always be grumpy if I missed my naps). Since I&#039;m now on phentermine, I am a more positive person, alert, super-alert. I hate washing dishes, pots, and now I have so much energy and willingness to be more in the kitchen and cleaning.  I sit with my son to help him with his homework. Now I find time to do stuff instead of &quot;relaxing&quot; or &quot;recharging&quot; my batteries in my bed.  This pill is amazing.  It has changed my lifestyle so far.  I do have some difficulty sleeping and dry mouth, but it&#039;s great.\"',\n"," '\"I was prescribed Imbruvica for CLL after being in remission for several years. The past protocols had always worked but where very hard on my system. The side effects weren&#039;t as extreme as with other treatments. But Imbruvica did not work at all for me. Taking the drug has made my health &amp; quality of life worse and now having stage 4 CLL my prognosis is grim. I lay in the hospital having numerous transfusions that are nothing more then a bandaid for my very soon eminent death.\"',\n"," '\"By far the best birth control pill I&#039;ve taken.\\r\\r\\nPeriods are super light and cramping is minimal to none. No weight gain or bloating.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nBest part for me is my insurance covers it for free! This has never happened for me.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nBiggest downsides I&#039;ve experienced are spotting if you are off by a few hours from your normal time and my mood swings are been considerable.  I&#039;ve found myself to be a little more irrational and emotional. I&#039;ve had a lot of stress, so I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s a direct effect of the pill, since no one else seems to be having mood swings.\"',\n"," '\"I&#039;ve been on this pill for about a month and I love it. No mood swings and same sex drive. The only noticable difference is my breasts! They are so tender. They feel as if I have a 90 pound clip hanging on my nipples. I do get nauseous through out the day but its bearable. My weight is the same. Sometimes I have an appetite, other times I don&#039;t. Overall, this is a great birth control.\"',\n"," '\"Started on 10mg of Viibryd and have been taking it for over 6 weeks.\\r\\nFirst week I experienced being &quot;spacey&quot;, diarrhea and no appetite.  After the first week, I started to feel better and have improved quite a bit.  Anxiety is gone but still have &quot;anger&quot; issues, although not as bad prior to Viibryd. \\r\\nAsking the doctor to up the dosage to 20mg to possible help with anger issues.\\r\\nOtherwise, Viibryd is about the best anti-depressant I&#039;ve ever taken.  Much better than Wellbutrin/Zoloft/Prozac/Celexa/etc.\"',\n"," '\"I have used valerian off and on for 26 years, no major side effect, at low doses. Usually I used this herb for insomnia which it works well. Also can be used for anxiety and stress; again at a low dosage. I would recommend on line information for your questions plus herbal specialists in your community. Do not  exclude your doctor a MD or equally qualified professional. I am now adding valerian at night in conjunction with \\r\\nZyprexa and Klonapin.   Zyprexa at 15 mg on e pill, Klonapin at 0.50 or 1 mg dose.  Do not recommend this combination yet to anybody. I am in the experimental phase.  Stormy1959\"',\n"," '\"Very good for me.\"',\n"," '\"Taking Wellbutrin 300XL for a while now. Previously used a SSRI which had little to no effect in that I would contemplate suicide nearly daily and had zero interest in life in general.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nNow I actually want to do things again, I am enjoying life and I have more energy. I can&#039;t say enough how well this drug has worked for me.

I noticed that when I stopped taking it that I could not sleep for days and I became shaky at times, and the anxiety returns immediately.

It didn&#039;t help at all. My DR kept slowly increasing my dose while I suffered from extreme anxiety with no relief.. I had weight gain, night sweats, oddly long menstrual  cycles, cramps, the urge to drink alcohol.  I went to another Dr that said the dose needed to be at least 225 to treat anxiety I was on 125 so he increased dosage. This made the side effects much worse and the weight gain. I didn&#039;t care about anything, I wasn&#039;t myself. I decided after 20 lb gain to stop and got tapered off. I became extremely ill it was like having the flu everyday for weeks.

Well we started our next round of court battles since I guess the ex isn&#039;t done annihilating me yet and same thing, panic, irritability, unable to think straight, thoughts swirling. A friend gave me a few 10mg Valiums and I couldn&#039;t believe how much they helped. I could actually THINK without freaking out!

I had prior, minor anxiety issues; but never had the need for medication or treatment. I was one of those people who thought anxiety/panic attacks were more of a mental/attention-seeking action. I was wrong. I now know what it&#039;s like to wake up at 1 am (sometimes reliving the scenario) and be in complete chest-pounding panic. I now know what it&#039;s like to have certain words or topics of discussion trigger major anxiety issues. I take this (1mg dose) med, as needed (post event, day or night), to help calm anxiety issues; currently 0-3 times per week (more a few months ago).\"',\n"," '\"I started taking Xanax at age 20 and it was a great medicine. I had such bad panic attacks and just constant anxiety 24/7.  I started out on a low dose and within 15 mins I felt calm and fine. I got from the place of not being able to walk outside or answer the phone to being able to get married, have a job, go on vacations. Anything I wanted to do. I WAS NORMAL.  But now I&#039;m 36 and on the highest dose 4 mg a day and about 4 1/2 years ago my horrible anxiety came back even though I&#039;m taking it.  I can&#039;t work, drive or really go anywhere anymore.

But thanks to clonazepam I can go through it pretty well and I am making life change that will be wonderful then. I hope I can get of clonazepam one time. I take 7 months approximately 0.5 mg a day. Sometimes I go several days without but most of them this dosage. Sometimes I take it twice a day. After my life changes will be done, I plan use clonazepam only for specific situations.

My second week was great, I started seeing very positive results. Pristiq really suppresses my appetite, but I&#039;ve only lost a couple of pounds. Constipation is also another thing to be prepared for. I take it in the morning and it boosts my mood. I am also taking clonazapem for the night time.

I take 0.5mg when I absolutely need it (2-3x every couple months.) but only reason I wouldn&#039;t give it a 9 or 10 because I did have a bad experience with this drug. I took it for 7 days straight 3x .5mg per day as prescribed by my doctor for generalized anxiety disorder. I abruptly stopped taking it because I didn&#039;t want to have to take it everyday and I ended up going thru a withdraw. I then got vertigo for a couple months, which was absolutely terrible.
